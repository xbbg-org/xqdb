# Release Rules

<!-- last-analyzed: 2026-08-28T02:50:00Z -->

## Version Sources

Every source below must hold the identical version string, and the tag must be
exactly `v<version>`. `.github/workflows/NPM.yml` job `source` enforces this and
fails the release on any mismatch.

| File                                          | Field                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Cargo.toml`                                  | `[workspace.package] version`                                  |
| `Cargo.lock`                                  | `version` of packages `xqdb`, `napi-xqdb`, `py-xqdb`            |
| `js-xqdb/package.json`                        | `version` only — see the pin note below                        |
| `js-xqdb/package-lock.json`                   | `version`, `packages[""].version`                              |
| `js-xqdb/npm/win32-x64-msvc/package.json`     | `version`                                                      |
| `js-xqdb/npm/linux-x64-gnu/package.json`      | `version`                                                      |
| `js-xqdb/npm/darwin-arm64/package.json`       | `version`                                                      |
| `js-xqdb/test/package.test.ts`                | `expect(root.version).toBe(...)` — asserts the literal version   |

The Python distribution has no version field: `pyproject.toml` sets
`dynamic = ["version"]` and setuptools-scm derives it from the git tag, so
tagging is what versions the wheel.

### Platform pins are injected, not committed

Neither `js-xqdb/package.json` nor `js-xqdb/package-lock.json` may declare
`optionalDependencies`, and the lock must contain no resolved
`node_modules/@xbbg/xqdb-*` entries. The `source` job asserts both.

The reason is that an exact pin names a version the registry does not serve until
the platform packages publish, so any committed pin makes a fresh checkout of the
release tag fail `npm ci` with `EUSAGE ... package.json and package-lock.json are
not in sync`. Removing only the resolved entries does not help; npm then reports
the three natives as `Missing` and `--omit=optional` fails identically. A tag is
immutable, so a post-publish lock refresh cannot repair it.

The `assemble` job therefore runs `npm run set-optional-deps`
(`js-xqdb/scripts/set-optional-deps.mjs`) after `npm run build:ts` and before
`npm pack`. It reads each `npm/*/package.json`, requires every name to be a
`@xbbg/xqdb-` platform package at exactly the root version, and writes the pins.
Immediately after packing, `node scripts/assert-packed-pins.mjs <tarball>
<version>` extracts `package/package.json` from the tarball and fails unless all
three pins are present at exactly that version. `publish` declares
`needs: [source, assemble]`, so neither step can be skipped and a root package
cannot be published without its pins.

Two approaches that do **not** work, so do not retry them:

- `napi prepublish -t npm --skip-optional-publish` validates that every
  `npm/<target>/` already holds its `.node` and aborts with
  `Release package ... is incomplete` otherwise. In `assemble` only the packed
  platform tarballs exist, so it cannot run there.
- `"workspaces": ["npm/*"]` links the platform directories unconditionally, so npm
  enforces their `os`/`cpu` fields and fails on every host with
  `notsup Valid cpu: arm64 / Actual cpu: x64`.

No release automation script exists; the bump is a manual edit across the files
above.

## Release Trigger

- **npm**: push a `v*` tag. `NPM.yml` builds all three native targets, packs,
  smoke-tests, and publishes.
- **PyPI**: manual `workflow_dispatch` of `CI.yml` with `dry-run: false`, from the
  default branch, and only on repository `xbbg-org/xqdb`. A tag push does not
  publish to PyPI.
- Tags must be pushed to the `xqdb` remote (`xbbg-org/xqdb`). `Taskfile.yml`'s
  `tag` task pushes to `origin`, which is `jshinonome/kola` — the upstream this
  project forked from. Do not use it.

## Test Gate

From `.github/workflows/Quality.yml`:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --exclude py-xqdb --all-targets --locked
cargo test --workspace --exclude py-xqdb --doc --locked
python -m pytest -q py-xqdb/test
```

Plus `npm test` in `js-xqdb` from `JS.yml`.

`py-xqdb` is excluded from `cargo test` deliberately: it is a `cdylib` and its
test binary cannot resolve the Python DLL. `cargo test --workspace` without the
exclusion fails with `STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND`.

Run each gate without a masking pipeline. `cmd | tail` reports `tail`'s exit
status, so a failing suite looks green.

Python tests exercise a live q fixture when `XQDB_TEST_Q_EXTERNAL=1`; otherwise
the live cases skip. `XQDB_Q_ROWS` must match the running fixture.

## Registry / Distribution

| Target | Package                                            | Publisher                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| npm    | `@xbbg/xqdb` plus three platform packages          | `NPM.yml`, on `v*` tag push      |
| PyPI   | `xqdb`                                             | `CI.yml` job `release`, manual   |

## Release Notes Strategy

Conventional Commits, no `CHANGELOG.md`. Tags are annotated with the message
`XQDB <version>`.

Notes live in `docs/release-notes/v<version>.md`, checked in before tagging. The
`github-release` job in `NPM.yml` passes that file to `gh release create
--notes-file` when it exists, and `gh release edit --notes-file` when the release
was pre-created; it falls back to `--generate-notes` only when the file is
absent. That job therefore checks the repository out — without a checkout the
file is not on disk, and the release silently degrades to commit subjects.

Subject lines alone are not sufficient when a release changes observable
behaviour, because `--generate-notes` emits only subjects and never a commit
body. Any release containing a breaking change MUST ship a notes file spelling
out the old behaviour, the new behaviour, and the migration. Draft the routine
part from `git log <prev-tag>..HEAD --no-merges --format="%s"`.

`v0.1.4` carries one such change — Python q timestamp atoms are now naive where
0.1.3 returned UTC-aware values — and its notes file already documents it.

## CI Workflow Files

- `.github/workflows/NPM.yml` — npm release on tag
- `.github/workflows/CI.yml` — PyPI release on manual dispatch
- `.github/workflows/Quality.yml` — Rust and Python gates
- `.github/workflows/JS.yml` — Node gates

## First-Time Setup Gaps

None. Release workflows exist, build artifacts are gitignored, and tags are in
use (`v0.1.0` through `v0.1.3`). `v0.1.4` is prepared in the manifests but not
yet tagged.
